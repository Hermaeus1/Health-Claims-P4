Project Outline

DONE Cluster on Region via get Dummies

Will need to test the significance of children on the data maybe the children's claims are included in the patient's? (If so bad data quality there)

DONE Supervised Diabetic Prediction would also be great! Update: Didn't work too well from dependence on pharmacy Data

DONE Supervised Smoker Identification would be great too! Update: Worked extremely well!

DONE Supervised Claim Amount Prediction might work! Update: Did Not Work, need more underwriting stuff. Clustered into Risk Categories, with moderate success for high-risk and low-risk.




RS use some flavor of SQL to clean data and establish a pipeline then fit

RS to write the extended readme/write up file for machine learning

RS to implement dummies/data cleaning 

Bonus Section:
EC use bayesian Algs to reproduce additional data to test the model on then price insurance on it (no breakdown on patient SBCs so just a straight projection with an assumed MOOP),
 Markov Chains with a discretized Kernel are likely the best direction. Easy to assign a CDF or even fit a poisson dist here. Worst Case Scenario use a surrogate distribution to closely emulate and see if the models highlight any differences.
